# DeepFake 101: Face Swap

This is a code repository for GradientCrescent's tutorial on the generation of a simple DeepFake, known as a Face-Swap. Based on Ovalery16's implementation of Shaoanlu's original DeepFake FaceSwap-GAN project, we've optimized the code into stand-alone modules for Google Colaboratory, aiming for maximum intutiveness, user-friendliness, and overall computational speed.

Detailed tutorial to be released on GradientCrescent in due course.

## Structure
